# SmartApps
The Catch me inside SmartApp is designed to work with internalpositioning.com and a device that can run their client program to enable the tracking of the client devices through different rooms in the home. This is effectivly an upgrade to presence sensors that instead of offery a binary home/not home can determine what room of your home you're in. 

Users will need to go through and crteate a preference entry for each location in their home they want to use with the SmartApp. You'll also need to create a virtual switch for each location in in your home. The last reequired step is editing the params to include your own group and user.
